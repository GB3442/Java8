====== Lambda Expression =========

Q.1 )  What is lambda expression ?
ans : - Lambda expresssion is nothing but a Anonymous function which doesn't having a name,return type and modifiers.
         or Lambda expression is basically an instance of a functional interface. or we can say it provide clear and
         concise way to represent a method of functional interface using an expression.

Q.2 ) Why we use Lambda Expression ?
ans : - To write a clear and concise code.

Q.3) What is syntax of lambda expression ?
ans : ()-> expression
      eg.
      // this is normal method
      public void show(){
      System.out.println("hello");
      }
      // this is lambda expression for above method.
      ()->System.out.println("hello");

Q.4) WHat is functional interface ?
ans: A interface which contain only one abstract method are called as functional interface.
     It is also called as SAM i.e Single Abstract Method
     => To represent an interface as functional interface we use @functionalInterface

Q.5 ) what are predefined functional Interfaces in java ?
ans : Callable => call() , comparable =>compareTo(), comparator => compare(), ActionListener Actionperformed(),
      Runnable => run() etc.
